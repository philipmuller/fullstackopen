    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    Note right of browser: JS takes over form submission, preventing default behaviour. New note sent to server.
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 201 Created - confirmation of new note creation in backend
    deactivate server
    Note right of browser: The JS script handles adding the new note to the page locally without waiting for a whole page refresh

```
